# Design Thinking Method Toolbox for IT Teams

This repository contains my master thesis about how to integrate *Design Thinking* into *agile IT development teams*, with the goal to increase empathy towards the own team and the end user as well as to increase product understanding. The final goal was to create a method toolbox that can be used in day-to-day development.

##The final toolbox consists of twelve methods
- Personal Inventory
- Character Profiles
- Customer Journey Map
- Five Whys
- Letter to Grandma
- A Beginner' Mind
- 30 Second Sketch
- Powers of Ten
- Feedback Capture Grid
- Five Finger Feedback
- Empathy Tools
- Paper Prototype
